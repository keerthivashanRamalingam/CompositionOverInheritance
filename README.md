# CompositionOverInheritance #OOPS #Inheritance
This repository will tell about the use of composition and it shows where inheritance makes the code difficult to maintain/ creating a duplicate code if we add a new feature


###  Why This Repo?
Inheritance looks easy but creates rigid, tightly coupled hierarchies.
Composition promotes loose coupling and extensibility.

Each example here shows:
- Inheritance-based design
- Why it failed ❌
- Composition-based redesign ✅

### Topics Covered
- Basic comparison (Car & Engine)
- Notification system (Email, SMS)
- Decorator pattern (Logging, Retry)
- Real-world analogy (Spring beans)
